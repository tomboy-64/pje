DISCLAIMER:

These are my solutions for various Problems on Project Euler. Three notes however.

1. Although I coded these programs without malintent, be aware that I'm not a a professional programmer and there may very well be grave programming errors in those programs that might give you slight headaches, hysterical fits of laughter or maybe even make your computer asplode. Point being, if you don't proofread what I wrote and execute code from an UNTRUSTED SOURCE, whatever happens IS YOUR OWN FAULT.

2. Occasionally I try to comment my code. However, I'm an easily frustrated male, who makes no attempt on being politically correct. So if you're easily offended by offensive swearing, don't read my code.

3. Project Euler is a great site with great problems. To train your brain. If you try to use my code to cheat that site: get lost. Get your own **** brain. This stash is intended to help you find a correct solution. And as a storage for me to (kind of) collect all the code i wrote over the past few years in one place.
